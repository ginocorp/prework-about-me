      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hey! I graduated with a BS in Biology at Florida Atlantic University. I am a former 
        medical student, but now aspiring to be a Software Developer. This is my first of
        many websites to come. Stay tuned!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Asuncion, Paraguay.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy cooking, watching sports, playing games, doing magic, and most of all 
        playing soccer.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I wouldn't mind having a job with any of the top tech companies, but I would also
        really enjoy working at a start-up where I can be a big impact on a company's
        success. Regardless of what I do I want to be in a position where can I use my skills 
        as a developer to help my family and other people. However, if this is purely a 
        question of fantasy, my dream job would be to play soccer professionally for Real 
        Madrid.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in a lot of places, but currently in Atlanta, GA.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have always had a strange attraction and belonging whenever I used any tech related
        objects and I really enjoy the aspect of creating things out of practically nothing. I
        feel that it brings my creative side and problem solving skills to use at all times.
